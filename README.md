##Jacob Laframboise

HPO Explorer is a program to read in a medical ontology and to 
organize it with children parent relationships emulating a tree
structure. 

It is for the second assignment in CISC 124. 

This project is organized into a subfolder for resources, and 
a subfolder for source code. The files correctly reference 
each other in this configuration.
