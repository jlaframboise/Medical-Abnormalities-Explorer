Data structure.

The file reader will go line by line in the input file.
when it encounters [item] it will make a new hashmap of string arraylists.
when it encounters an attribute, it will get the arraylist corresponding to
the 'key' of the hashmap. It will append its entry to the arraylist.

when a blank line is found it will make a new item object with the hashmap of
String arraylists passed as attrs input. the constructor will iterate through possible
keys in the hashmap and if the arraylist is not empty, it will set the items
attributes to the items in the arraylist.

The attributes of the item that can be repeated will have to be string arrays or
arraylists.

Another approach:
make a class for item that has a mostly blank constructor
read through the input file. When item is encountered, make a new item object.
keep reading lines and add the attributes directly to the itme object with setters
that add the item to the attribute that would be string lists.

right under root there are 5 nodes, for each section of the data

when there are multiple is_a's, just take the first path to the root
